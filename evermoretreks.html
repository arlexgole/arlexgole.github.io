            <p> October 2018 - Ongoing </p>
            <p> Solo Side Project </p>
            <p> I have always wanted to help my home country of Nepal, but I felt under qualified and was never really was sure how to go about it. Recently, I became familiar with the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and have grown to truly admire social enterprises that have been able to successfully scale their organization while making a difference in the world (Warby Parker, MealShare, TOMS, and many others). Inspired and motivated, I want to use my design and business skills to create my own social enterprise in Nepal. </p>

            <h3> High-Level Problems </h3>
              <p> 1. Despite making improvements in recent years, Nepal remains one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. </p>
              <p> 2. Tourism is one of the largest industries in Nepal and plays a key role in the economy. However, it is facing many challenges, such as environmental, technological, and external competition. </p>

            <h3> Research (Interviews) </h3>
            <p> I interviewed people with years of experience in Nepal’s tourism industry including tour guides, local business owners, and a manager of a trekking agency. Setting up these interviews was a bit challenging since I was on the other side of the world. Nonetheless, I was able to gain a holistic perspective of the industry. </p>

              <li class="lists"> Trekking agencies get clients through many different channels including their physical office, referrals from hotels, and online bookings. Each channel has its advantages and disadvantages. </li>
              <li class="lists"> Trekking prices vary depending on many different factors (group size, lodging, quality of guides, ability to bargain, vulnerability of tourists, etc.). </li>
              <li class="lists"> Due to the profitability of the tourism industry, it is an extremely competitive industry. Unhealthy competition has led to price wars, dodgy operators, and many unethical business practices. </li>

            <h3> Competitive Analysis </h3>
              <p> Many of the bigger trekking agencies in Nepal have a website that provides information about their company and trek offerings. I analyzed these websites to learn more about the current competition and identify any strengths or weaknesses that I can build on.</p>

              <p> It has been a very challenging but rewarding experience to work at the intersection of entrepreneurship and design. Although 
              my high-level problem scope still seems very daunting, I believe that using the process of human centered design, I have taken a step
              in the right direction. </p>
              <P> I plan to continue working on this project and my goal is launch the website by the end of the year. In order to
              accomplish this goal, it will require many more cycles of research, design, and user testing. </p>
