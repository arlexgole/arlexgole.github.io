        <h1> Background </h1>
        <p> Jan 2019 - May 2019 </p>
        <p> The senior capstone project at Carnegie Mellon provides students an opportunity to apply what we have learned in the classroom to the real world. </p>
        <p>My team worked with the Human Computer Interaction Institute to design a novel interface for middle-school math classrooms. After 15 weeks of user-centered research and iterative designs, we created DesQ, a smart desk that facilities effective collaboration.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <h3> Problem Statement</h3>
        <p> Collaboration can be a magical thing. Many studies have shown that collaboration can lead to benefits such as increased learning performance and experience in middle-school classrooms. However, there are many barriers that prevent collaboration from happening in middle school classrooms. </p>
        <p> From our research, we discovered that one of the biggest challenges for teachers is the limited time. Collaborative activities can be time inefficient compared to lectures, especially considering all the material teachers have to cover. There are also other barriers such as complicated group dynamics and the difficulty of assessing collaboration. </p>

      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <h3> Research: Literature Reviews </h3>
        <p> We started off by doing a literature review on the vast amounts of existing research on student collaboration in the classroom setting. Each of us investigated an aspect of collaboration in the classroom: pairing of students with different skill levels, groups of 3+ students, group discussions, lab work, and study groups. We compiled the notes from this research and created an affinity diagram to extract the key insights.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
          <h4>Finding 1: Collaboration can help increase learning performance</h4>
          <p>Many studies have shown that collaboration, whether in pairs or groups, can help increase learning performance. Collaboration encourages students to build their knowledge of the subject matter and also exposes them to multiple perspectives. Furthermore, collaborating in groups can be effective for developing "soft" skills like lateral thinking and problem solving, things that might not be taught directly in a class. </p>
          
          <h4>Finding 2: Collaboration benefits students by encouraging engagement</h4>
          <p>While student collaboration often has the goal of increased learning performance and scores, it has the added benefit of encouraging engagement in the classroom. Students who might not normally participate in a setting involving the entire class can be drawn into smaller-scale activities, allowing them to better verbalize their thoughts, questions, and confusions. </p>

          <h4>Finding 3: Students' proficiency levels within the pairs/groups impact the learning experience</h4>
          <p>In any classroom setting, there is bound to be a range of student proficiencies
          and prior knowledge. Some research shows that the proficiency levels of the students in a group may affect the learning experience of the students. For instance, a low-proficiency student would have more to gain from being grouped with high-proficiency students, while high-proficiency students would benefit most from other high-proficiency students. However, other studies suggest that the compatibility of the students’ personalities are more important than proficiency levels when it comes to collaborative learning. </p>

          <h4> Finding 4: Teachers play a major role in successful student collaboration </h4>
          <p> Teachers also play a very important role in contributing to the effectiveness of collaborative learning. In the process of organizing collaborative activities, teachers have the responsibility to guide students, select worthwhile problems for students to solve, and encourage students to share their ideas. </p>

    <!--------------- teacher interview --------------->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <h3> Research: Teachers’ Interviews </h3>
          <p> We conducted four interviews with local middle school math teachers in order to get a primary perspective on collaboration within the classroom. Our goal from the interviews was to develop a deeper understanding of the way these teachers utilize collaboration in their classrooms and what strategies they think works best for their students.</p>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/teacher_interview.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>

      <h4> Insight 1: Teachers perceive that students can be better at teaching their peers at times due to their ability to empathize with each other. </h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="lists"><i>“Some students didn’t understand my lecture and it wasn’t until the group activities that they had their ‘aha’ moment”</i></li>
       <li class="lists"><i>“Sometimes the students can explain it better to each other than I can”</i></li>
        <li class="lists"> Teachers realize that during lectures, some students might still be struggling or not understand a concept completely. Since students can share similar perspectives about a problem or a concept, they are able to provide more relevant help at times. </li>
      </ul>

      <h4> Insight 2: Teachers need to adapt their collaboration strategies to different classroom dynamics </h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="lists"> <i>“I’ll build in different scaffolding if I feel that students are going to get distracted and have a hard time focusing. I’ll build in prompts in the middle of a question and have students stop and discuss at certain checkpoints.”</i></li>
       <li class="lists"><i>“I’m a white teacher in a predominantly African-American classroom, so sometimes I need to make sure that students don’t think I’m picking on them” </i></li>
        <li class="lists"> There many different dynamics in the classroom that impacts how students learn in the classroom. Teachers are usually able to understand these dynamics and adapt their teaching methods to best suit their class.  </li>
      </ul>

      <h4> Insight 3: While teachers believe collaboration can lead to deeper understanding, limited class time often discourages them from organizing prolonged group activities </h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="lists"><i> “I have a lot of content to go through and I am accountable for the standardized test scores. So, sometimes collaboration just takes too much time.”</i></li>
       <li class="lists"> <i>“I wish I had twice the time. It can come down to coverage vs. depth of the material.”</i> </li>
        <li class="lists"><i>Sometimes the challenges of collaborative activities outweigh the benefits. At the end of the day, teachers have a lot of content to go through and collaborative activities take a back seat.</i></li>
      </ul>

   <!--------------- card sorting --------------->
   <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3> Research: Card Sorting Session With Students  </h3>
        <p> We decided to conduct a card sorting session rather than an interview to make it more productive and engaging when talking to middle-school students. We had three middle school students participate in an inspiration card activity. We asked questions about collaboration and classroom technology, and provided cards with relevant keywords to help them structure their answers. </p>
        <p>We asked questions such as “Pick the card that you think is the best way to make groups work with in class”, “Pick the card that best matches how you feel about having discussions with other students about what you’re learning in class.” </p>
    <div class="under_images">
        <img src="images/card_sorting.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
    </div>

    <h4> Insight 1: Sometimes students can be better at teaching their peers </h4>
    <ul>
     <li class="lists"><i>“Sometimes other students will explain a concept in simpler terms, and I’ll get it better than the teacher’s explanation”</i></li>
     <li class="lists"><i>“Group discussions help students who need to catch up”</i></li>
      <li class="lists"> Collaborative activities can be beneficial for students because it allows them to hear different perspectives. Students also stated that, compared to lectures, it can be more engaging to hear from other students. Furthermore, students can sometimes deliver information in a way that is more understandable to other students. </li>
    </ul>

     <h4> Insight 2: Collaborative activities need to be better regulated to increase effectiveness.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li class="lists"><i>"Some kids don’t want to talk in discussions, so we make up discussion results” </i></li>
     <li class="lists"><i>“Sometimes people don’t do their part and I have to do all the work”</i></li>
      <li class="lists"> Students realize that problems such as different personalities can get in the way of productive collaboration. As a result, some students want teachers to be more involved during group activities to foster equal participation and recognize individual contributions.</li>

      <h3> Visioning – Generating  </h3>
        <p> With the research insights we gained from our literature review, teacher interviews, and card-sorting sessions, we transitioned into the visioning phase. During this stage, our goal was to be generate a wide variety of ideas and push our creative boundaries. </p>
      <div class="under_images"> 
        <img src="images/vision_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">

        <img src="images/storyboard_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <h4> Initial Ideas:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="lists"> A conversational interface that can function as the teacher’s assistant and provide help to students. It can help facilitate group activities by providing instructions, relevant information, and answering questions. There is also the monitoring aspect, in which the CUI is able to collect certain audio and analyze it. </li>
        <li class="lists"> A “smart” desk with that is able to facilitate collaboration by personalizing the activity and provide real-time feedback. Utilizing the novelty and uniqueness of the smart desk, there is an opportunity to also increase engagement. The smart desk is able to collect data on how students work and get a better understanding of their thought process.</li>
        <li class="lists"> An application that forms groups and pairs students based on proficiency levels. The system would analyze the effectiveness of the collaboration and provide an incentive system for students to collaborate. </li>
      </ul>

  <!--------------- speed dating --------------->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3> Visioning – Speed Dating  </h3>
        <p> We conducted speed dating sessions with middle school math teachers to see what they thought of our ideas and gauge their initial reactions. </p>

      <ul> 
        <li class="lists"> Teachers believe that the current technologies aren’t well suited for math classrooms. One teacher mentioned that his class had just received laptops, but he doesn’t even use them because it’s hard to write formulas and show your work. He still prefers to use pen and paper in the classroom.  </li>
        
        <li class="lists"> Teachers were really excited about the data analytics aspect. They emphasized that it would be really helpful for them to see what kind of errors students were making and being able to identify students struggling. </li>
       
        <li class="lists">Teachers had mixed reactions to our ideas. Some stated that an application grouping students wouldn’t be much help, while others loved the idea of forming groups to optimize collaboration. Some loved the CUI’s ability to monitor students but they were concerned about privacy. Some teachers thought the smart desk had a “wow factor”, while others didn’t really understand how it would work. </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/speedate_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
        </div>

      <p> We also received feedback from our client and faculty mentors on our ideas. After synthesizing all the feedback and considering many different factors, we chose to continue with the smart desk concept. The smart desk presented a unique opportunity to solve the problems in a novel and exciting way.</p> 
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--------------- lo fi --------------->
   <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3>  Lo-Fi Prototype</h3>
         <p> We created more storyboards and scenarios to demonstrate how the smart desk can solve current pain points and highlight its key features. </p>
         <p> We used paper, clear acrylic boards, and dry erase markers to assemble our low-fidelity prototype. Our low-fidelity prototype was tested by four Carnegie Mellon students. This served as a “pilot test” before we brought our prototype in front of actual middle school students. </p>
         <p> During the user testing session, students would solve Algebra I math problems independently. Then the smart desk would transform into “collaboration mode” and the students would work together to solve more math problems. </p>

         <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/lofi_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
        </div>
        <h4> Insight 1: There are physical constraints that make it hard to collaborate. </h4>
        <p> Our lo-fi prototype had anti-affordances that actually made it physically challenging to collaborate. The orientation made it difficult for students on the opposite side to view certain parts of the desk. Students had to turn their heads and bodies to read. Some parts of the desk were inaccessible because it was too far from the student.</p>
        <h4> Insight 2: Providing instructions can help guide the collaborative activity. </h4>
        <p> We can foster and guide collaboration through better instructions. In our study, we had a “lock out” period where the students couldn’t write on the desk and instead had to discuss with each other. In the future iterations, we want to improve this feature to better guide collaboration. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--------------- mid fi --------------->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3> Mid-Fi Designs </h3>
      <p> We learned a lot from our low-fi prototype testing session and were ready to create higher fidelity designs. As a result, our next step was to find a medium to use as our prototype. After considering many different options, we decided to use the Microsoft Perceptive Pixel. The perceptive pixel has a large 55-inch display and a built-in world class touch experience. As a result, it offered the most time effective way to prototype. </p>

      <h4>Collaboration Mode </h4>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/midfi1_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <p> Based on the user testing sessions, we realized that a group of 4 students was too large to effectively collaborate in the context of solving middle school math problems. As a result, we reduced the group size to 2 students. </p>
      <p> This screen shows what collaboration mode looks like for two students. In our scenario, collaboration mode happens once the students have finished their individual work. In collaborative mode, students are working together to spot errors. The shared content is in the middle, making it easily accessible to both students. Students also have access to their individual notes and toolbar on their respective sides. </p>

      <h4>Turn Taking</h4>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/midfi2_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <p> We started exploring this idea of turn taking because we wanted both students to take active parts in solving the problems. One way we tried to facilitate turn-taking is by dividing the activity itself into different steps. For example, the first step in the activity is finding the error, and the next step is redoing the problem. Also, the first step of the activity is closer to the student on the left, while the second step is closer to the student on the right. We were curious to see if this would impact how the students collaborated in solving the problems. </p>
      <p> Our hypothesis was that dividing the activity into different parts will make it easier for students to collaborate. Furthermore, we started thinking about how we could design the screen so that both students would have to contribute to the activity, whether through writing, speaking, or listening. In an ideal session, the students would discuss the problem, then each student would take turns solving part of the problem.</p>

      <h4>Real-time feedback </h4>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/midfi3_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <p> Since DesQ would be able to collect a lot of data such as the student’s work, time spent on problems, and past errors, we decided to utilize that data to improve the learning experience. We believed that there was a unique opportunity to provide real-time feedback to students. </p>

      <p>For example, students can receive personalized hints as they are solving the problem. In the screen above, a student who might be struggling with the distributive property can get a hint explaining how the distributive property works. This also helps teachers save time and energy because DesQ can serve as an extra hand for the teacher in the classroom. </p>

      <h4> Novel Interactions </h4>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/midfi4_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <p> Because of its size and multi-touch surface, there is an opportunity to design novel and unique interactions. We wanted to take advantage of that and try to experiment with different kinds of interactions. For example, rather than just clicking a submit button, students can drag or slide their work to the middle to submit their work. We wanted to test if these interactions can increase engagement and provide a better experience for students. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--------------- user testing --------------->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3> User Testing Session </h3>
        <p> We ran another user testing session with middle school students to test our mid-fi prototype. Similar to the low-fi user testing session, we used an activity where students worked individually at first and then collaborated to find errors and redo the problem. The goal of the user testing session was to test some of our hypotheses around facilitating collaboration and novel interactions.</p>
        <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/usertesting_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <h4>Insight 1: Designing a smart desk has unique physical constraints  </h4>
      <p> There were many physical limitations and constraints that we didn’t consider in our designs. For example, students rest theirs arms on the desk when writing and their arms cover parts of the screen. As a result, one student didn’t even see the hints appear on his screen. </p>
      <p> In the future iterations, we have to be more careful and strategic about where we place things on the screen. We started thinking about possibly using the space on the top to display important information. Also, possibly using animations to make things more noticeable. </p>

      <h4> Insight 2: Fostering productive collaboration requires a more complex and structured design </h4>
      <p> Our designs weren’t effective enough in fostering collaboration. Although the activity was divided into different parts and the content was accessible to both students, that wasn’t enough to facilitate effective collaboration. During the study, one student took over and just did the whole activity by himself. On the other hand, the other student just watched and did not contribute at all.</p>
      <p> We realized that the system had to do more. We need to ensure that both students stay engaged and have the opportunity to participate. We also started thinking about what it means to design a system that adapts to different skill levels. </p>

      <h4> Insight #3: Novel interactions can provide really delightful experiences </h4>
      <p> The students found the novel interactions such as dragging/sliding their work to middle to submit really exciting and fun. Students experienced this “wow” factor when interacting with the desk.</p>
      <p> In the future, we want to incorporate more of these interactions. We started brainstorming interactions that can bring delight to the users and also be effective in helping complete the task at hand.  </p>

    <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
      <h3> Design Iterations </h3>
        <p> Based on the user testing session, we synthesized the learnings and iterated on our designs. These are a few of the changes we made. </p>
      <h4> Individual Mode</h4>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/indv_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <p> We rethought how we positioned elements on the screen. For example: notifications are on the top of the screen, making it easy for students notice. We also wanted to expand the working space and really take advantage of the screen size.</p>

      <h4> Collaboration Mode</h4>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/collab_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
      </div>
      <p> The system takes a more active role in facilitating the collaboration. For this activity, the system divides the problem between the two students. Once a student completes his or her step, the problem is swiped over to the other student. There are also instructions on top to further encourage collaboration. Our hypothesis was that this design would keep both students engaged and also promote productive discussions between students.</p>
      <h4> Automated Hints</h4>
      <div class="under_images">
          <img src="images/hints_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">

        <h4> Insight #1: A combination of structured turn-taking and scaffolding can help foster effective collaboration </h4>
        <p> In this testing session, the collaborative activity was a success. Both students were engaged and worked together to solve the problem. Although far from perfect, our design concepts of scaffolding the activity and required turn-taking showed a lot of potential. </p>

        <h4> Insight #2: The instructions need to be clearer to avoid confusions </h4>
        <p> There were a few issues with the wording in the instructions. For example, one of the instructions asked the student to complete the “first step” of the problem. However, this confused the students since that can mean many different things. For the next iteration, we plan to solve these pain points.</p> 

        <h4> Insight #3: The smart desk has a “wow” factor that excites students </h4>
          <p> Lastly, the smart desk seems to have this "wow" factor due to its novelty. Students expressed a lot of excitement and delight when interacting with the interface. </p> </li>

        <h3> Final Designs </h3>
          <p> We iterated on our designs again after the user testing results. We got into the details of the visual language, wording, and established further clarity in each interaction.</p>

        <h4> Animations </h4>
        <div class="under_images">
            <img src="images/final1_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
        </div>
        <p> From testing, we learned that the interactive instructions and personalized hints are very helpful. However, sometimes the students can miss what is happening on the screen. Therefore, we added animations so that any update on the screen is more noticeable. </p>

        <h4> Collaboration </h4>
        <div class="under_images">
            <img src="images/final2_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
        </div>
        <p> In order to facilitate turn-taking and allow both students to participate in the problem-solving process, we designed a board that slides back and forth. Our system also provides relevant instructions and guidelines to both students. For example: it prompts students to slide the board to their partner once it detects that they have done their part.  </p>

        <h4> Real-time Feedback </h4>
        <div class="under_images">
            <img src="images/final3_desq.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"> 
        </div>
        <p> In individual mode, when the system analyzes that the student is struggling with the problem, it can provide relevant hints. Similarly, during the collaborative activity, the system can provide personalized hints and feedback to the students. For example, if the students submit the correct answer, the system proceeds to the next step. However, if the students submit the wrong answer, the system provides the correct answer and presents an example that the students can learn from. </p>

  <!---------------  Next steps --------------->
     <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <h3> Next Steps </h3>
          <p> Our project has come a long way since the start of the semester but this is only the beginning. There is a lot of room for improvement and further research. Throughout this project, we identified a number of interesting research questions and possible next steps. </p>
          <ul> 
            <li class="lists"> DesQ could potentially collect really helpful data including the students’ work, errors made, time spent on a problem, and much more. Analyzing this data can help bring many unique insights and improve the education experience. For example, the data can empower teachers by helping them identify struggling students quicker. </li>
            <li class="lists"> While we had to scale our scope down to middle school math classrooms and a group size of two students. We would like to explore the how DesQ could work for bigger group sizes and other subjects. </li>
            <li class="lists"> As mentioned earlier, another concept that we briefly explored was a conversational interface. It would really interesting to see what it could look like if DesQ had a conversational interface (like Siri or Alexa). For example: it could answer student questions, help facilitate discussions, and provide helpful hints. </li>
          </ul>
