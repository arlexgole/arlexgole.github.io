            <p>  Amazon Custom’s vision is to be the largest marketplace for buying and selling of personalized, customized, or configurable products and services. </p>
            <p> I led the research, design, prototyping, and testing of the customization and personalization experience. I worked closely with product managers and business managers to ensure that my designs not only solved customer pain points but also aligned with the business goals and technical constraints.  </p>
            <p> Unfortunately, due to NDA I can’t share specific details about my work. If you have any questions about my internship at Amazon, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:arlex97@gmail.com">arlex97@gmail.com</a>!

            <h3> Main Takeaways </h3>
              <p> 1. Customer Obsession: Start with the customer and work backwards. During my project, I used many different methods and processes to ensure that I was always starting with the customer. From filtering through thousands of customer reviews to conducting user testing sessions, I was able to really empathize with the customer pain points. Establishing this empathy was really important and helped shape my entire project. </p>
              <p> 2. Working With Data: I never had the opportunity to work with data at this scale before. Utilizing the data helped me make better design decisions and understand the different tradeoffs involved. It also made it easier to explain/defend certain design decisions to other stakeholders. </p>
              <p> 3. Building the Highway: With millions of users using the product, it can become really difficult to design for all the different use cases. There are times where a certain flow or interaction might work perfectly for one use case but isn't quite right for another. My manager told me to think about it as "building a highway that works for many as opposed to designing one perfect road". By working closely with the different stakeholders, I developed a better understanding of what use cases to prioritize in order to build the highway. </p>
              <p>4. Established Design Systems: It was extremely helpful to use existing components and think about how my design fits within a larger ecosystem. Rather than thinking about how a specific button might look like, I was able to focus more on designing the user flows and the interactions that best solve the customer pain points. However, there were also instances where the design system didn't work or didn't have the components I needed. I was able to make a case for why I had to design a new component or interaction and build on the existing system..</p>
