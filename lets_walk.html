          <p> Computing for Good is a course at CMU that gives students the opportunity to work on projects in partnership with communities, non-profits, and government agencies to solve real world problems (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/learning-doing-good" target="_blank">learn more about the course</a>).</p>
          <p> My team partnered with the borough of West Homestead in Pittsburgh to design a fitness app that encourages walking in the community. Although the residents of West Homestead would be the initial users, the goal of the app to is to <b> help solve the greater problem of physical inactivity.</b></p>

          <h2> My Role </h2>
          <p> I was able to participate in many different parts of the projects including conducting user research, ideating, and prototyping. However, my main role was creating the high-fidelity designs for the app. </p>

          <h3> Guerilla Research </h3>
            <p> We first posted a survey on the community website to get a general idea of the residents' exercise habits. Since West Homestead is only a 30-minute bus ride away from campus, we were able to head over and strike up conversations with the residents. From these interviews and the survey, we were able validate some our client's initial assumptions and also discover new insights. </p>
            <p> One valuable thing that we learned was that walking seemed to be the most preferred type of exercise and this might be because West Homestead, like many segments of the Pittsburgh Metro Area, has an aging population. We also discovered a large range of physical activity amongst the residents, from people who exercise daily to those who exercise occasionally when they have some free time. Lastly, every resident we interviewed described the community as very neighborly. </p>

        <h3> Concept Map </h3>
        <p> After visiting our clients and doing some field work, our group discussed the scope of the project and our initial findings. I created a concept map to represent our shared understanding of the project and prioritize the most important aspects of the application. </p>

        <h3> Competitive Analysis </h3>
          <p> I conducted a competitive analysis to learn about the different fitness apps in the market and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Although there were many different fitness apps in the market, there was not a single app that directly met our client's and targeted user's needs. </p>
          <p> There was an opportunity to create a fitness app that focused on encouraging walking and provided a strong sense of community to motivate users.</p>

        <h3> Takeaways </h3>
        <p> From this project, I learned a lot about balancing the various stakeholder and user needs. It is important that I am not only focused on representing the user but also thinking about how my designs bring value to the stakeholders. I also learned about the importance of prioritization, especially early on in the project. Looking back on this project, I think I could have done a better job focusing on two or three key features. </p>
        <p> The next steps for this project are conducting more usability tests, designing some of the more specific interactions (how the coins work), and starting to develop the main features. </p>
